                            <p>African Entertainment industry is one of the very biggest African export with billions of dollars in cashflow. Before now,music and movie royalty deals were carried out secretly amidst very select few,but SOUNDMART has provided a platform for decentralisation through individual micro-ownership and benefit from music and movie royalties in Africa,So you can own a bit of a song/album or a movie and earn royalties in just few minutes.</p>
                            <p>A particular song/album/movie continues to bring in royalties till atleast 70 years after the creator's death,making music/movie royalty investments one of the longest term passive investment.</p>
                            <p>Marketplace components:</p>
                            <p>SOUNDMART royalty Marketplace consists of:</p>
                            <p>Auction:</p>
                            <li>Here we list music/movies assets with a starting price set by the seller.</li>
                            <li>Once a listing gets a bid,the auction begins and usually lasts for about three business days.</li>
                            <li>Once the suction ends,the highest bidder wins the auction.</li>
                            <p>Fixed listing:</p>
                            <li>Here there is no auction,the creator's can make a fixed public listing of their content with their intended target amount,and investors can make an offer on it at any time with the creator accepting to close the deal.</li>
                            <li>In this fixed listing,investors can buy a fraction of the whole target amount for as low as $100,meaning that numerous investors can invest on one listed content to meet the target.</li>
                            <li>Other assets previously acquired by an investor who wants to resell will also be listed here.</li>
                            <li>You as an investor can accept the creator's listed target offer,pay and take the whole royalty income or buy as many units as you can,one share unit is a low as $100.</li>
