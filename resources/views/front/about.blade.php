                            <p>SOUNDMART is set out to completely decentralise the entertainment industry financially.
                                A lot of individual investors want to invest in the entertainment industry but can't join the clique based gatekeepers who take the lion's share from the industry.
                                African Entertainment industry was designed to benefit few closed knit people,making royalty transactions and entertainment deals to be done within closed doors to discourage competition,fairness, transparency and of course to direct most of the proceeds of the value created to the gatekeepers than to those who actually created the content.
                            </p>
                            <p>Only about 1% of the really good artists can survive such closed systems like this and when they do,it's not because it favoured them but because they don't have a choice.</p>
                            <p>In SOUNDMART we believe that the person who should get and dictate cashflow should be the content creator,and all creators should have an equal platform to access funding and grow their career,own their life and be independent so we created a marketplace which gives creators who earn royalties the ability to share them with any investor(s) interested in paying them directly a fair price.</p>
                            <p>We don't sell or buy royalties,we don't provide advances or loans.</p>
                            <p>We simply present a marketplace where buyers and sellers can meet and find the value they seek.</p>
