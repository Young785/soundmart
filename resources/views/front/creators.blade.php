                            <p>SOUNDMART is designed as a decentralised platform that connects content creators with individual investors in a way that the creators(music artists,movie producers) can enjoy their freedom and still retain copyrights to their songs,movies etc</p>
                            <p>We eliminate the middlemen who make it harder for 99% of truly creative and talented musicians or movie producers to grow their career because they concentrate only on a select few based on personal preference,this we do by creating a truly accessible platform and exposure for all.</p>
                            <p>When you list your music or movies,the investors are investing on royalty revenues only,and not copyright ownership of your products. This means that you can sell the royalties of just one song off your album or the whole album.</p>
                            <p>You can also sell just a percentage of your royalties to investors while you keep the other percentage for yourself.</p>
                            <p>You can sell royalties of just one stream of your royalty revenue(For instance;you can sell only royalties proceeds from online streaming to investors,while you keep the rest of the revenue streams for yourself).</p>
                            <p>You also have the option of listing your royalty offer duration as advance term(giving up your royalties for s particular period of time like 10 years after which you continue to receive your royalties) ot  fixed term(permanently give out the royalties to that particular song,album or movie)</p>
                            <p>All you are doing is raise bulk money by directing some or all of your future royalty payments to someone/people.</p>
                            <p>The royalties you sell do not include new songs or songs outside the content you listed on our platform.</p>
